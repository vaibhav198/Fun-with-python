# print_statement.py

In this python file, I have just tried to understand how a print statement affect the execution time of pipeline. I took two for loops, in 1st for loop, I put one print statement and in 2nd for loop, I did not put any print statement. And we can see the difference. So the conclusion is whenever we are going to put our pipeline/system in production, we must try to put as minimal print statement as possible. (I have realized this when I was doing final testing of one of my computer vision project)
